"""Fetch the precomputed dashboard SQLite files from a GitHub Release.

Both dashboard DBs are larger than GitHub's 100MB hard blob limit (and Git LFS is
disabled for this repository), so they are published as release assets instead of
being committed -- see the `.gitignore` entries for them. A Weka checkout, or any
machine that rebuilt them locally, already has them on disk and never downloads.
A fresh clone (Streamlit Community Cloud, most notably) has neither, and this
module is what lets the dashboard serve the final analysis there with no Weka or
SSH access.

Which results the dashboard serves is pinned by environment, so republishing is a
new release plus an env change rather than a code change:

  CASF_DASHBOARD_RELEASE       release tag to pull from (default below)
  CASF_DASHBOARD_RELEASE_REPO  `owner/name` holding the release (default below);
                               the app itself may be served from a mirror, while
                               the assets stay on the canonical repository

Only the two files the app actually opens are fetchable. `casf_per_ligand_long.csv`
is a rebuild input for the extended analysis, never read by the dashboard, and is
deliberately not listed here.
